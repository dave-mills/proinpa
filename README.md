# Proinpa Info App
This app is designed for [La Fundaci√≥n PROINPA](http://www.proinpa.org/), as a way of communicating information about quinoa growing (and eventually other crops).  This includes information about different varieties, risks associated with certain stages of the growing cycle, and options for managing those risks.  

The app is being developed by [Statistics for Sustainable Development](http://stats4sd.org), in association with the [McKnight Foundation](https://www.mcknight.org/).  It is built using the Ionic 2 platform. 

###Downloading and Compiling
To download and run a version of this app, please see the ionic website for tutorials.  [http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/)

Note - can additionally be build to support older devices using crosswalk. To build using crosswalk run:
```sh
cordova build android
```
This will produce 2 apks, roughly 20MB larger than standard build (arm7 used on most devices)


Merging: the base branch is where you think changes should be applied, the head branch is what you would like to be applied.
